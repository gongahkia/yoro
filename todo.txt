# --- STRETCH GOALs (DONT DO FIRST) ---

notice to users that if they're trying to access yoro on a mobile devive they cant use it there, pleaase use it on a proper device for now with actual keyboard support since it is primiarly a keyboard based editor for power users
generate logo with nanobanana
do an audit of existing features and make sure everything makes sense
move all archived feature files into a literal folder called archive in repo root
add auth and make sure security is airtight
add basic user accounting and a profile page
add syncthing and other free syncing options as file storage
if sufficiently good, consider packing with tauri or redeveloping in swift for native macos support but then make it as good as notion
