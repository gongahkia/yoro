provide a way for users to drag and drop images or copy and paste them from their clipboard straight into the drawing canvas
make it so that clicking a completed saved drwaing will bring it back into edit mode and make it still editable. how are drawings currently being stored? if svg or a more efficient method, then this should allow for easy reloading and editing right
for each drawing, allow it to be exported to any relevant format as necessary
allow any image that is copied/pasted into the editor when clicked on to be edited as well
allow all drawings/images to be resized easily
refactor how the homescreen currently shows notes to be something more intuitive and useful like notion or google docs
harden all security entry and endpoints
alllow all drawings/images/tables/diagrams to be centered/resized easily
remove the font family font type and font size optiosn from command palette for now

# --- STRETCH GOALs (DONT DO FIRST) ---

notice to users that if they're trying to access yoro on a mobile devive they cant use it there, pleaase use it on a proper device for now with actual keyboard support since it is primiarly a keyboard based editor for power users
generate logo with nanobanana
do an audit of existing features and make sure everything makes sense
move all archived feature files into a literal folder called archive in repo root
add auth and make sure security is airtight
add basic user accounting and a profile page
add syncthing and other free syncing options as file storage
if sufficiently good, consider packing with tauri or redeveloping in swift for native macos support but then make it as good as notion
